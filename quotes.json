  "Bubbles are invariably associated with new developments.",
  "There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.",
  "Bubbles and crashes are times when extreme events cause people to lose their objectivity and view the world through highly skewed psychology – either too positive or too negative.",
  "It’s not what you buy, it’s what you pay that counts.",
  "Good investing doesn’t come from buying good things, but from buying things well.",
  "There’s no asset so good that it can’t become overpriced and thus dangerous, and there are few assets so bad that they can’t get cheap enough to be a bargain.",
  "It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the return on an investment is significantly a function of the price paid for it. For that reason, investors clearly shouldn’t be indifferent to today’s market valuation.",
  "In bubbles, investors treat the leading companies – and pay for their stocks – as though the firms are sure to remain leaders for decades."
