  "Bubbles are invariably associated with new developments.",
  "There is nothing so disturbing to one’s well-being and judgment as to see a friend get rich.",
  "Bubbles and crashes are times when extreme events cause people to lose their objectivity and view the world through highly skewed psychology – either too positive or too negative.",
  "It’s not what you buy, it’s what you pay that counts.",
  "Good investing doesn’t come from buying good things, but from buying things well.",
  "There’s no asset so good that it can’t become overpriced and thus dangerous, and there are few assets so bad that they can’t get cheap enough to be a bargain.",
  "It shouldn’t come as a surprise that the return on an investment is significantly a function of the price paid for it. For that reason, investors clearly shouldn’t be indifferent to today’s market valuation.",
  "In bubbles, investors treat the leading companies – and pay for their stocks – as though the firms are sure to remain leaders for decades.",
  "Attributing a cause or explanation to events gives us a sense of control and makes the world, and our lives, seem less uncertain.",
  "Regression to the mean.",
  "When undisciplined investors are out there with lots of money to get rid of, there’s less scope for disciplined investors to insist on strong covenants.",
  "The less prudence with which others conduct their affairs, the greater the prudence with which we should conduct our own affairs.",
  "There can be few fields of human endeavor in which history counts for so little as in the world of finance.",
  "Economists have physics envy. They want to explain the economy and markets with hard and fast rule akin to Newton's Laws of Motion. The problem is that economics is not like physics with its immutable laws.",
  "Imagine how much harder physics would be if electrons had feelings.",
  "There are two kinds of forecasters: those who don’t know, and those who don’t know they don’t know.",
  "It’s frightening to think that you might not know something, but more frightening to think that, by and large, the world is run by people who have faith that they know exactly what’s going on.",
  "What the wise man does in the beginning, the fool does in the end.",
  "Optimism, trust in future, faith in investments, low level of skepticism and risk tolerance, not risk aversion don't make a positive climate for returns and safety.",
  "It’s important to play judiciously, to have more successes than failures, and to make more on your successes than you lose on your failures. But it’s crippling to have to avoid all failures, and insisting on doing so can’t be a winning strategy. It may guarantee you against losses, but it’s likely to guarantee you against gains as well.",
  "You miss 100% of the shots you don’t take.",
  "Superior investment results can only stem from a better-than-average ability to figure out when risk-taking will lead to gain and when it will end in loss.",
  "The fact that something’s cheap doesn’t mean it’s going to appreciate tomorrow; it can languish in the bargain basement. And the fact that something’s overpriced certainly doesn’t mean it’ll fall right away; bull markets can go on for years.",
  "In times of crisis, all correlations go to 1."
